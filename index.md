Case Study: The Barn at Brewer Street - A Triumph of Collaboration and Cost Control
Project Overview: A Modern Home with Historic Roots
Client: Private Homeowners Location: Brewer Street, Farnham, Surrey Project Type: Residential Barn Conversion Services Provided: Cost Management, Quantity Surveying, Project Oversight, and Contract Administration.

This project involved the ambitious conversion of a dilapidated 19th-century barn on the outskirts of Farnham into a contemporary four-bedroom family home. The clients' vision was to create a light-filled, energy-efficient living space that celebrated the building's agricultural heritage by retaining original features like the vaulted ceilings and exposed timber beams.

The Challenge: Navigating Complexity and Unexpected Costs
Barn conversions are notoriously complex, often presenting unforeseen challenges that can derail budgets and timelines. This project was no exception. The initial structural survey revealed the need for significant and costly underpinning due to the barn's lack of traditional foundations.

Furthermore, the clients, while passionate about their vision, had a fixed budget and were concerned about the potential for costs to spiral out of control. They needed a clear and accurate financial picture from the outset and robust cost management throughout the build to ensure their dream home didn't become a financial nightmare.

The Solution: Castle Consultants' Expertise in Action
The clients engaged Castle Consultants to provide comprehensive cost management and quantity surveying services. Our role was to bring financial clarity and control to every stage of the project.

Our key interventions included:

Detailed Cost Planning and Budgeting: We began by preparing a meticulous Bill of Quantities (BoQ), providing a detailed breakdown of all anticipated material, labour, and professional costs. This gave the clients a realistic and transparent budget from day one.
Thorough Tender Process: Castle Consultants managed the entire tender process, from preparing tender documents to evaluating submissions from local contractors. This ensured the clients appointed a reputable builder at a competitive price.
Proactive Cost Control: Throughout the construction phase, we diligently monitored all expenditures against the budget. When unforeseen issues arose, such as the need for additional structural steelwork, we worked collaboratively with the architect and builder to find cost-effective solutions without compromising on quality.
Value Engineering: Our team identified several opportunities for value engineering. For example, we suggested alternative, locally sourced cladding materials that offered the same aesthetic appeal and durability as the initial specification but at a significantly lower cost.
Contract Administration and Valuations: We administered the building contract, ensuring all contractual obligations were met. Regular site visits allowed us to carry out accurate valuations of work completed, ensuring the contractor was paid fairly and on time, which helped to maintain a positive and productive working relationship.
The Result: A Stunning Home Delivered On Time and On Budget
Thanks to the diligent cost management and proactive problem-solving of the Castle Consultants team, the barn conversion was completed within the agreed timeframe and, crucially, within the clients' original budget.

The finished home is a testament to the clients' vision and the collaborative spirit of the entire project team. It seamlessly blends rustic charm with modern luxury, creating a unique and highly desirable living space. The project's success has been a source of immense pride for the homeowners, who are now enjoying their dream home in the heart of the Surrey countryside.

Client Testimonial:

"We couldn't have navigated this complex project without the team at Castle Consultants. Their expertise in cost management gave us the confidence to embark on this conversion, and their proactive approach saved us from a number of potentially costly issues. They were an invaluable part of the team, and we are thrilled with the final result."
